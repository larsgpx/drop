### Main issues and how to solve them
**Outdated PHP version**

**Site is on subdomain**
Use the main domain as example.com. Do not use technical domains, domains '.local', etc.

There may be following reasons for such errors:
- Your cURL is outdated
Get in touch with your host’s support team with the request to update their cURL library to the latest version.
- No open incoming connection available on your server
Request your host’s support to allow open incoming connection for your website.
